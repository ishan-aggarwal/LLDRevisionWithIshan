### Q1. Snake & Ladder Game Class Diagram - 1

Design a class diagram for the traditional game of Snake and Ladder with the following requirements:

1. Board: A standard Snake and Ladder board contains 100 cells numbered from 1 to 100.
2. Players: The game can be played by 2-4 players.
3. Dice: The game will have a standard dice that can roll numbers between 1 to 6.
4. Snakes: Snakes will have a start point (mouth) and an endpoint (tail). If a player lands on the mouth, they are taken
   down to the tail.
5. Ladders: Ladders will have a start point (bottom) and an endpoint (top). If a player lands on the bottom, they climb
   up to the top.
6. Turns: Players take turns in a round-robin fashion to roll the dice and move.
7. Winning Condition: A player wins if they land on the 100th cell exactly. For example, if a player is on the 99th
   cell, they must roll a 1 to win.
