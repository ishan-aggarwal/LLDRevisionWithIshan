**Description of Battleship Game Rules and Steps:**

**Game Setup:**

* The game is played on two grids for each player: one for their own ships and one for tracking shots against the
  opponent.
* Each player secretly arranges ships on their grid. Ships can only be placed vertically or horizontally, not
  diagonally.
* The standard fleet includes a variety of ships (e.g., Aircraft Carrier, Battleship, Submarine, Destroyer, Patrol
  Boat), each occupying a different number of consecutive squares.

**Gameplay:**

* Players take turns firing shots to attempt to hit the opponent's ships.
* After a shot, the opponent must respond with "hit" or "miss."
* If all squares of a ship are hit, the ship is sunk. The player should announce the sinking (e.g., "You sunk my
  battleship!").

**Winning the Game:**

* The game ends when a player has sunk all of their opponent's ships.
* The first player to sink all of the opponentâ€™s ships wins the game.
