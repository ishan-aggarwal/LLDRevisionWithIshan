# Divide by Zero Exception (Assignment)

## Problem Statement

Write a program that takes two integers as input and divides them. Handle the potential ArithmeticException (divide by
zero) using try-catch.Print an appropriate message “Divide by Zero Not Allowed” and return -1 in case of an exception
else return the result.

## Instructions

1. Implement the `divide` method inside the `DivideByZero` class
2. You need to return the floor value of `numerator/denominator`
3. Use the try-catch block to implement the function and return the output.
4. In case of ArithmeticException exception, print the message `Divide by Zero Not Allowed` and return `-1`
