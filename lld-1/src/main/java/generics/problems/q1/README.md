# Generic Pair Class Implementation (Assignment)

## Problem Statement

Design and implement a generic class named Pair that encapsulates a pair of values, where these values can be of any
type. The class should provide mechanisms to store two values of generic types and methods to access these values.
Ensure your implementation is generic enough to support pairs of different types.

## Instructions

1. Declare two private instance variables within the `Pair` class to store the pair values. The types of these variables
   should be generic, allowing for any object type.
2. Implement a constructor for the `Pair` class that initializes the pair with two values. The constructor should accept
   two parameters corresponding to the types of the pair values.
3. Implement methods `getFirst()` and `getSecond()` within the `Pair` class to retrieve the first and second values of
   the pair, respectively.
