# Generic Array Printing Method (Assignment)

## Problem Statement

Develop a generic method named `printArray` within a class named `PrintArrayElements`. This method should be capable of
printing the elements of any array, regardless of its data type, to the console. Each element should be followed by a
space, and no newline character should be printed after the last element. The purpose of this assignment is to
familiarize you with generics in Java, allowing you to work with arrays of different types using a single method.

## Instructions

1. Inside the `PrintArrayElements` class, implement the `printArray` method. This method should be generic, enabling it
   to accept an array of any type as its parameter.
2. The method should iterate through the array and print each element followed by a space. Ensure that no newline
   character is printed after the last element of the array.
