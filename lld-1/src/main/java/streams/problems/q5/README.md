# Sorting using Streams - Sort Animals (Assignment)

## Problem Statement

You are given a list of strings which stores the names of animals. Your task is to use **streams** and **lambdas** to
sort the given list according to the length of the strings in descending order of length.

If two or more strings have the same size then return in the order in which they exist in the original list.

## Instructions

1. Implement the `sortAnimalsByLengthDescending` method inside the `AnimalSorter` class
2. You need to use **parallel streams** and **Lambdas** for doing the operation.
3. If the size of the given list is 0 then return an empty list.
