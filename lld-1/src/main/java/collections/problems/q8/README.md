# Student Sorter(Assignment)

## Problem Statement

You are given a class `Student` which stores the data of each student. The `Student` class has two variables, `name` and
`age`. Now you are given a list of `Student` and you need to sort the given list of students according to their age in
descending order, i.e. the student with the highest age comes first and the student with the lowest age comes last.

**Note:** You do not have to create a new list of students, just sort the given list according to age in descending
order.

## Instructions

1. Implement the `sortStudentsByAgeDescending` method inside the `StudentSorter` class.
2. Sort the list in descending order of age.
3. If two or more Students have the same age then keep them in the same order as they appear in the input list.
4. The code for class `Student` is already implemented.
5. Use `Comparator` to sort the given list.
