# Generic Comparison (Assignment)

## Problem Statement

Implement a generic method named `compare` that can compare two objects of any type that supports comparison (i.e., any
type that implements the `Comparable` interface). This method should leverage the objects' `compareTo` method to perform
the comparison.

## Instructions

1. Create a generic method `compare` within a class named `GenericComparison`.
2. The method should take two parameters of the same type and return the result of comparing the two.
3. Ensure the objects passed as parameters implement the `Comparable` interface.
