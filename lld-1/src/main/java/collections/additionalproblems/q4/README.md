# Frequency Count(Assignment)

## Problem Statement

You are given an array of integers, and you need to count the frequency of each integer present in the array using a
`Map` and return the map as the answer.

- Use `Map<Integer,Integer>` to solve the question.
- The keys of the map are the elements of the array.
- The values of the map are the frequencies of those elements.

## Instructions

1. Implement the `countFrequencies` method inside the `FrequencyCounter` class.
2. You don't need to print anything, just implement the function and return the map that stores the elements and their
   frequencies.
3. The order of the keys inside the map does not matter.
