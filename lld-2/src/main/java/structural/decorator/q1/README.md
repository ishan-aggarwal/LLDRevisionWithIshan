# Decorator Pattern for Image Editing Application

## Problem Statement

You are working on an image editing application where users can apply various filters and effects to their images.
However, the current implementation of the application is becoming monolithic, with each filter or effect tightly
coupled to the main image editor class. Moreover, adding new filters or effects requires modifying the existing code,
leading to maintenance issues and potential bugs.

You want to refactor the image editing application to make it more flexible and maintainable. You decide to use the
Decorator pattern to allow users to dynamically add filters and effects to images without modifying the existing
codebase.

## Assignment

Your task is to implement the Decorator pattern to enhance the image editing application. The Decorator pattern allows
behavior to be added to individual objects dynamically, without affecting the behavior of other objects of the same
class. This pattern is particularly useful when you need to add or modify the behavior of objects at runtime.

### Task 1 - Implement the ImageEditor Interface

You have been provided with a base class named `StorageManager`, which represents the main image editing functionality.
Your first task is to create the `ImageEditor` interface. You need to complete the `ImageEditor` interface by adding a
method:

- Add a method `render` that returns a `String` representing the image rendering operation.

### Task 2 - Implement the RawImageEditor Class

Next, you need to implement the `RawImageEditor` class, which is a concrete implementation of the `ImageEditor` and
simply renders the raw image. The tasks are as follows:

- Implement the `ImageEditor` interface to render the raw image.

### Task 3 - Implement the BaseImageDecorator Class

Now, you need to implement the `BaseImageDecorator` abstract class, which is the base class for all decorators. Each
decorator should have the same methods as the product it decorates, i.e., `render`. It also needs to call the next
decorator in the chain and finally call the raw image editor. The tasks are as follows:

- Inherit from the `ImageEditor` interface.
- Store a reference to the next layer of type `ImageEditor`.

### Task 4 - Implement the BlurImageDecorator, SharpenImageDecorator, and GrayscaleImageDecorator Classes

Finally, you need to implement the `BlurImageDecorator`, `SharpenImageDecorator`, and `GrayscaleImageDecorator` classes,
which are concrete decorators that add specific filters to the image editing application. The tasks are as follows:

- Implement the `BlurImageDecorator` class to apply a blur effect to the image. Use the `ImageUtils.applyBlur` method
  for this purpose. Remember to call the next layer in the chain while rendering the image.
- Implement the `SharpenImageDecorator` class to apply a sharpen effect to the image. Use the `ImageUtils.applySharpen`
  method for this purpose. Remember to call the next layer in the chain while rendering the image.
- Implement the `GrayscaleImageDecorator` class to apply a grayscale effect to the image. Use the
  `ImageUtils.applyGrayscale` method for this purpose. Remember to call the next layer in the chain while rendering the
  image.

### Instructions

1. Create the `ImageEditor` interface and add the `render()` method.
2. Implement the `ImageEditor` interface in the `RawImageEditor` class to render the raw image.
3. Complete the `BaseImageDecorator` abstract class by implementing the `ImageEditor` interface and storing a reference
   to the next layer of type `ImageEditor`.
4. Create the `BlurImageDecorator` class to add a blur effect to the image.
5. Create the `SharpenImageDecorator` class to add a sharpen effect to the image.
6. Create the `GrayscaleImageDecorator` class to add a grayscale effect to the image.
7. Run the provided test cases in the `TestImageDecorator` class to verify the correctness of your implementation. You
   are not required to edit the test cases themselves.
